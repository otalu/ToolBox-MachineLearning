Questions

1) What is the general trend in the curve?
2) Are there parts of the curve that appear to be noisier than others? Why?
3) How many trials do you need to get a smooth curve?
4) Try different values for C (by changing LogisticRegression(C=10** -10)). What happens?

Answers

1) The general trend is a positively inclining linear curve.

2) Some parts of the curve are more noisier than others. The possible reason
for this is because we divide the data into the training set and test set randomly.
So, assuming that there are bad images in the entire dataset, randomization does not
guarantee that there is an even distribution of images to test and training subsets.
So in any parts of the set, if the program is trained with bad images, it gives bad
results when compared to good images and vice versa. This problem should diminish, if we increase
the number of trials.

3) 100 trials produce a somewhat smooth curve. 1000 give a nearly smooth curve; however I
did not look at larger values.

4) The number determines the inverse of regularization constant, hence the smaller the
value put in, the output is regularized better to fit the logistics regression. As the
C value is decreased, we can see that the curve gets less and less close to Logistic
regression.
